# üåê Website Layout Redesign   - UI Project

Welcome to my website layout redesign project! This repository contains a modern and responsive user interface (UI) built to give a fresh new look to an existing website. The redesign focuses on improved user experience, visual hierarchy.

## üîç Overview

The project is a front-end redesign of a previously outdated layout. My goal was to make the website more modern, user-friendly, and visually appealing using clean HTML, CSS (or a framework), and JavaScript (if applicable).
